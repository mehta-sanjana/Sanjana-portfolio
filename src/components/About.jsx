                        As a dedicated student specializing in Computer Science and
                        Engineering, I possess a strong foundation in computer fundamentals,
                        web development, and problem-solving with a focus on data structures
                        and algorithms (DSA). I have gained proficiency in key programming
                        languages such as Java, C, and C++, allowing me to efficiently
                        implement solutions to complex problems. Through hands-on experience
                        in web development, I have mastered HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc. enabling
                        me to create dynamic and responsive websites.
                        Additionally, I have sharpened my problem-solving skills through
                        coursework and personal projects, utilizing DSA concepts to optimize
                        code performance. With this diverse skill set, I am equipped to
                        tackle challenges in the realm of technology and contribute to
                        innovative solutions.
